### About me...
I am a software engineer who is focused on front-end development. My specializations are web and mobile software development, responsive design, and user-friendly interfaces. I have a solid knowledge of the JavaScript language, as well as strong skills in React, React Native, Html5, Css3, and NodeJs. The quality, performance, and maintainability of applications I build are a top priority for me. Striving to be a lifelong learner, I am very interested in furthering my knowledge of concepts such as web3 and blockchain.
